The victim was allegedly kidnapped while returning from a medical shop and subjected to sexual assault. The incident was reported after a delay, and the victim's age was questioned due to discrepancies in the birth certificate. The prosecution relied on the victim's testimony and medical evidence, while the defense argued lack of evidence and delay in reporting."
