2023, dated 19th January, 2024, whereby the co-accused Amin
Mohammed Shaikh has been released on bail and the order dated 9th
February, 2024 in BA No. 2589 of 2023 whereby the co-accused
Shashikant @ Babubhai Chandrakant Kolwalkar has been released on bail.
4)
The learned Counsel for the applicant submitted that nothing has been recovered at the instance of the applicant. While releasing co-
accused Shashikant Kolwalkar, this court had, inter alia, observed as under:-

“10… Prima facie, it appears that the first informant had initially lodged a report of theft by an unknown person,
while he was travelling in a bus. The allegations of robbery appeared to have been made after about 10 days of the alleged occurrence. Prima facie, the aspect of delay in making the allegations of robbery bears upon the veracity of the claim of first informant and would, thus, be a matter for trial.”
5)
The said co-accused and the other accused were released on bail,
though there was recovery at the instance of those co-accused, as the
Court was of the view that the question as to whether the property which has been recovered at the instance of those co-accused formed part of the property of which the first informant was allegedly robbed of would be a matter for adjudication at the trial.
6)
The applicant has been in custody since 28th July, 2021. it is very unlikely that the trial can be concluded in the near future. Therefore,
