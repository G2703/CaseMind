appointed for the appellant, who is in jail and Mrs.
Gajre, learned A.P.P.
2. The present accused, who was accused No.4 along
with accused Nos.1 to 3 was convicted for the offence
punishable under section 399 and 402 Indian Penal Code
and was sentenced to undergo R.I. for five years and to
pay fine of Rs.3,000/- and in default to undergo R.I.
for six months on each count. He was also convicted for
the offence punishable under section 4 r/w section 25 of

[2]
Arms Act and was sentenced to undergo S.I. for two
years and to pay fine of Rs. 2,000/- and in default to
pay fine to undergo further S.I. for six months. The
substantive sentence of imprisonment on all counts was
to run concurrently. The impugned judgment and
conviction was passed on 28/11/2005. The
accused/appellant preferred this appeal through jail
challenging the conviction and sentence. According to
him the trial Court had not scrutinised and appreciated
the evidence properly and has committed error in
convicting him. He also prayed that the sentence of
fine may be reduced.
3. I have carefully gone through the whole evidence
and the impugned judgment. I have also perused a report
dated 15/4/2007 from the Superintendent, Kolhapur
Central Jail, which shows that the accused is likely to
be released from jail on 1/5/2007, after undergoing
complete sentence, including the sentence of
imprisonment in default to pay fine on all the three
counts.
4. According to prosecution, on 28/3/2001 P.W.1
Police Constable Rane was on patrolling duty in Zhaveri

--- Page 3 ---
[3]
Bazar. At about 5.30 P.M. from some informant he got
information that six unknown persons had assembled in
Trimurti Market, Zhaveri Bazar with intention to commit
dacoity. That informant also pointed out those six
persons to Police Constable Rane. Constable Rane
watched their activities and one of them indicated that
"the dacoity was to be committed in the Zhaveri shop on
the first floor of Trimurti Market", while another
person uttered "let rush of people reduce" but he
advised his companion to keep the weapons ready. After
this, police constable Rane contacted P.W.5 Assistant
Police Inspector Parab and informed him about this
information. API Parab went to the spot along with
staff members. At about 7 to 7.15 P.M., Police
Constable Rane joined them and pointed out the said
persons. When the police tried to nab them, two of then
ran away but four persons were arrested. From the
custody of accused Nos. 1 and 2, two small knives and
from the custody of accused No.3 Ismail Shaikh, a
chopper were recovered. These weapons were seized. No
weapon was found with accused No.4, who is the present
appellant. All these four persons were taken in
custody. A case was registered. During the
investigation, it was revealed that some of the accused

--- Page 4 ---
[4]
persons were also involved in other criminal cases.
After investigation charge-sheet was filed against all
four accused persons and charges were framed. Accused
pleaded not guilty.
5. On behalf of prosecution in all six witnesses
were examined. Relying on the testimony of these
witnesses, the trial Court convicted and sentenced all
the four accused persons for the offence punishable
under section 399, 402 of IPC and for the offence
punishable under section 4 r/w section 25 of Arms Act.
6. Taking into consideration the evidence led by
prosecution and the fact that the accused appellant is
already in custody since 28/3/2001 and as per the report
from the Superintendent, Central Jail Kolhapur, the
appellant is going to be released shortly after
undergoing the complete sentence, including the
sentenced awarded for the offence including Arms Act,
the learned Counsel for the appellant did not press the

## Appeal Details

402 of IPC. However, he pointed out that the conviction
under section 4 r/w section 25 of the Arms Act cannot be
sustained for two reasons. Firstly,the accused was not

--- Page 5 ---
[5]
found in possession of any weapon and therefore, he
could not be convicted under section 25 of Arms Act.
Secondly, the prosecution had failed to produce any
evidence that there was any Notification issued by the
Central Government under Section 4 of Arms Act banning
the possession and carrying of any such weapons.
7. Section 3 of Arms Act Provides that no person
shall acquire, have in his possession, or carry any
firearm or ammunition unless he holds a licence for that
purpose. Section 4 of Arms Act deals with weapons other
than the firearms. It reads as follows:-
"4.- If the Central Government is of opinion
that having regard to the circumstances
prevailing in any area it is necessary or
expedient in the public interest that the
acquisition, possession or carrying of arms
other than firearms should also be regulated, it
may, by notification in the Official Gazette,
direct that this section shall apply to the area
specified in the notification and thereupon no
person shall acquire, have in his possession or
carry in that area arms of such class or
description as may be specified in that
notification unless he holds in this behalf a
licence issued in accordance with the provisions
of this Act and the rules made thereunder."
From this section it is clear that while for firearms in
view of the provisions of section 3 of Arms Act, it is

--- Page 6 ---
[6]
necessary to hold a valid licence normally no licence is
required to possess any arms other than the firearm
unless there is a Notification published in the Official
Gazette by the Central Government for that purpose and
made applicable to the particular area specified in the
notification. If such a notification is issued for a
specified area no person may acquire, posses or carry
any such weapon, without necessary licence. Before a
charge under section 4 r/w section 25 (1B) of the Arms
Act could be framed, it was necessary for the
prosecution to allege that there was such a notification
issued by the Central Government made applicable to the
particular area in which the accused persons were found.
In the present case in the charge-sheet nowhere there is
any mention of any such notification under section 4 of
the Arms Act, nor any evidence was led before the Court
that there was any Notification issued by the Central
Government prohibiting possession or carrying of any
such weapon in particular area. In absence of any such
Notification, merely because a persons is found in
possession of a weapon, other than the firearms, he
cannot be prosecuted, convicted and sentenced under
section 25 of the Arms Act.

8. Section 25 (1B) of the Arms Act Provides
as follows:-
"(a).-acquires, has in his possession or carries
any firearm or ammunition in contravention of
section 3.
(b).- acquires, has in his possession or carries
in any place specified by notification under
section 4 any arms of such class or description
as has been specified in that notification in
contravention of that section.
(c).-....
(d).-....
(e).-....
(f).-....
(g).-....
(h).-....
(i).-....
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which shall not be less than one year but which
may extend to three years and shall also be
liable to fine."
9. In view of these provisions it is clear that
only the person, who is found in possession of firearms
without valid licence or any weapon, other than the fire
arms, in contravention of such a notification under
section 4 of the Arms Act, can be prosecuted and
convicted but no other persons who is not in possession

--- Page 8 ---
[8]
of such a weapon can be convicted with the help of
section 34 of Indian Penal Code. The principle of joint
or vicarious liability on the principle of committing
the offence in furtherance of common intention cannot be
applied in case of possession of weapon by one of the
accused persons. In relation to offence under section
397 and 398 IPC, it is well settled that only the
accused, who is in possession of or who uses such a
weapon, while committing the offence of robbery, can be
convicted but the others accused in the same group
cannot be convicted under section 397 and 398 of IPC, if
they themselves were not in possession of such a weapon.
In view of the language of section 25(1B) Arms Act, same
principle and analogy will be applicable to the offence
pertaining to section 4 r/w section 25 of the Arms Act
also.
10. In the present case, the appellant/accused No.4
was admittedly not in possession of any weapon and
therefore, he could not be charged and convicted under
section 4 r/w section 25 of the Arms Act. Further as
pointed out above the prosecution never pleaded not
proved that there was any notification issued by the
Central Government under section 4 of the Arms Act for

--- Page 9 ---
[9]
the area in which these accused persons were found, no
offence under section 4 r/w section 25 of the Arms Act
could be said to have been committed by the accused
persons. In view of these circumstances, the conviction
of the accused/appellant under section 4 r/w section 25
of the Arms Act, is liable to be set aside.
11. Appeal is partly allowed. While the conviction
and sentence for the offences punishable under sections
399 and 402 of Indian Penal Code are hereby maintained,
the Conviction and sentence for the offence punishable
under section 4 r/w section 25 of the Arms Act is hereby
set aside.
