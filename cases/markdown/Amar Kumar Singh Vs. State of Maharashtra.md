The FIR is lodged by the Police Constable Nitin
Lokhande attached to Robbery Cell, Pimpri Chinchwad. He has stated that on 26.5.2023 on prior information they raided a flat in front of the MCA Cricket Stadium on Mumbai-Pune
Expressway. The raiding party found four persons sitting in that flat taking the bets on the match which was going on at that time. The raiding party seized certain mobile phones and other gadgets used for taking the bets. It is mentioned in the
FIR that the accused had procured SIM cards based on forged documents. On this basis, the FIR is lodged.
4.
Learned counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Applicant is not named in the FIR. There is not even direct or indirect connection of the Applicant with the alleged offence. The Applicant’s anticipatory bail application was rejected because it was submitted before the Sessions Court that he had helped the others in procuring the SIM cards and he was the main culprit behind the offence.
