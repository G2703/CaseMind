13-BA-191-2022-WITH-3090-2021.doc were present at the scene of offence. Shiban Shafi Shaikh has been granted bail by this Court vide order dated 11th August, 2022 passed in Bail Application No.3804 of 2021. This Court had also dealt with the objection of the prosecution about invoking the provisions of
MCOC Act and observed that for lack of evidence the restriction under Section 21(4) of MCOC Act will not be applicable for refusing bail to the said accused. It was also observed that the only material against Shiban Shaikh is the statement of Monu Warma. No eye witnesses have stated about the presence of the said accused as one of the friend of assailants who was present to render help, if required. The prosecution case hinges upon the statement of the said witnesses. The version of Monu Warma and Suraj Kumawat is identical against the applicants and co-accused Shiban Shaikh. The confessional statement of Yogesh Bodke refers to the fact that the applicant Akshay Parache and the co-accused Shiban Shaikh and some others were supposed to be around the place of incident to backup the assault. However, the statement does not mention that they were present at the time of assault to support the assailants.
The confessional statement of Kalam Salim Rahim does not attribute any role to the applicants. The confessional statement of Sahil
Mhaske also does not attribute any role to the applicants.
