imprisonment for 7 years apart from direction to pay fine of
Rs.5,000/- and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6
months vide the impugned judgment and order.

Facts, in brief, leading to the prosecution and resultant
conviction of the appellant/accused no.2 in Sessions Case No.135
of 2010 are thus :
(a) First Informant Vijay Sadavate boarded the local train on
24th October 2009 from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
Terminus station for going to his house after working hours.
He alighted at Chembur Railway Station at about 11.30 p.m.
One Mansoor was with him. By walk, they proceeded by the
side of the railway track. At that time, three accused persons
came. One of them caught hold of collar of shirt of the First
Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate and by extending threat of
killing him, tried to extract cash and valuables from him.
He gave blow of knife on back side of head of the First
Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate causing bleeding injury.
Another accused caught hold of Mansoor and pushed him.

The accused persons then fled from the spot of the incident when Mansoor shouted for help. Police from Chembur Police Station came on the spot and the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate was admitted to Shatabdi Hospital, where he lodged report which resulted in registration of Crime No.57 of 2010 with Police Station Chembur.

(b) During investigation, it is revealed that soon before this incident, the accused persons waylaid PW2 Pradeep Pawar and asked him to deliver his wrist watch to them. He refused and scuffle ensued, during the course of which, he was assaulted by one of the accused by means of a knife. His right index finger ring had fallen. He had taken medical treatment at Rajawadi Hospital.

(c) During investigation, robbers came to be arrested. Test Identification Parade was conducted. On completion of routine investigation, they came to be charge-sheeted.

(d) The learned trial court framed Charge for the offence punishable under Section 394 read with 397 of the Indian Penal Code. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

(e) In order to bring home the guilt to the appellant/accused, the prosecution has examined as many as ten witnesses. The defence of the accused persons was that of total denial. They, however, did not enter in defence.

(f) After hearing the parties, by the impugned judgment and order, the learned trial court was pleased to convict appellant/accused no.2 Aakash Chavan along with co-accused Rais @ Jamil Bashir Shaikh and sentenced them as indicated in the opening paragraph of this judgment. However, the third accused came to be acquitted.

I have heard Mrs.Nasreen Ayubi, the learned advocate for the appellant/accused no.2. She argued that nothing was

## Page 5

looted from either the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate or
PW2 Pradeep Pawar. Evidence of the prosecution is suffering
from discrepancies and inconsistencies. No weapons came to be
seized during the course of investigation. Therefore, the
appellant/accused no.2 is entitled for acquittal.

The learned APP supported the impugned judgment
and order.

I have considered the rival submissions and carefully
perused the record and proceedings including oral as well as
documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution.

Case of the prosecution is based on testimony of the
First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate and that of PW2 Pradeep
Pawar, who are said to be the victims of the crime in question.
Similarly, there is evidence regarding Test Identification Parade in
which both these witnesses have identified the appellant/accused
no.2 as one of the robbers. Both these witnesses are injured

witnesses and as such, their presence on the scene of the
occurrence suffers from no doubt.

As per version of the First Informant/PW1 Vijay
Sadavate, after reaching Chembur Railway Station by local train,
when he was proceeding by the side of the railway track along
with his friend Mansoor, three persons came there and accosted
them. As per version of this witness, one of them gave a blow of
knife on backside of his head and he was asked to take out the
cash with him. The First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate deposed
that second person caught hold of his friend Mansoor and the
third person terrified them. As deposed by this witness, he
shouted loudly, so also his friend Mansoor, and as such, the public
gathered on the spot and apprehended the culprits. The First
Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate deposed that appellant/accused
no.2 Aakash Chavan is one of the robbers who pushed Mansoor.
In cross-examination this witness admitted the fact that he had
seen accused persons at the police station, at the time of lodging
the report. This witness stated that the accused persons were

injured when they were brought to the police station. Cross-examination of the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate shows that then subsequently, Test Identification Parade was conducted, where also he identified the appellant/accused no.2.

8 So far as PW2 Pradeep Pawar is concerned, he has stated in his evidence that three accused persons accosted him and directed him to remove his watch. He was assaulted by them and in the assault, he sustained bleeding injury to his right palm and his right index finger ring had fallen down on the spot. While in the dock, PW2 Pradeep Pawar has duly identified appellant/accused no.2 as one of the robbers.

9 There are minor discrepancies in evidence of the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate and PW2 Pradeep Pawar, in so far as timing of the local train reaching Chembur Railway Station is concerned. However, both these witnesses were returning to their home after finishing day's work. It is not expected of them to correctly recollect the time of alighting from the local train at

avk 7/10


## Page 8

208-APPEAL-290-2014-J.doc
Chembur Railway Station and therefore, minor discrepancy in the
time of reaching Chembur Railway Station is of no consequence.
Evidence of PW2 Pradeep Pawar reflects that the incident in
respect of him took place first, and thereafter, the incident of
attempt to rob the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate took place.

PW5 Dr.Sandeep Kedar had medically treated the First
Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate where as PW7 Dr.Nitin More had
medically treated PW2 Pradeep Pawar. Evidence of PW5
Dr.Sandeep Kedar shows that the First Informant/PW1 Vijay
Sadavate had suffered contused lacerated wound on occipital area
apart from similar wound on right hand. Evidence of PW7
Dr.Nitin More shows that PW2 Pradeep Pawar had suffered injury
on right hand at base of thumb. Thus, medical evidence is
supporting the version of the injured witnesses regarding attempt
to rob them by accused persons.

Evidence of PW8 Hiralal Parmeshwar, panch witness,
shows that during inspection of the spot of the incident, stains of

blood were found on stones and one finger ring was also found,
which came to be seized vide Panchnama Exhibit 64. This
evidence corroborates version of both injured witnesses.

12 Dock identification is the substantive evidence and in
the case in hand, the First Informant/PW1 Vijay Sadavate and
PW2 Pradeep Pawar have identified the appellant/accused no.2
during the course of adducing evidence. There is nothing in their
cross-examination to doubt this dock identification which
constitutes substantive evidence. The incident was that of
attempted robbery in the vicinity of Chembur local Railway
Station. Thus, there was ample opportunity with these two
injured witnesses to see the robbers. As such, even if evidence of
Test Identification Parade is discarded because of possibility of
seeing the accused persons in the police station, evidence of dock
identification of the appellant/accused no.2 by the victims cannot
be discarded. Similarly, I find no substance in the submission of
the learned advocate for the appellant/accused no.2 that nothing
was recovered from the appellant/accused no.2. The case in hand

avk

is a case of attempted robbery and as such, recovery is not
required.

13 In the light of the foregoing discussion, the
prosecution has successfully established that the appellant/
accused no.2 had attempted to commit robbery and in that
attempt, had used deadly weapon. No interference in the
impugned judgment and order, as such, is warranted. Therefore,
the order :

## ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.
