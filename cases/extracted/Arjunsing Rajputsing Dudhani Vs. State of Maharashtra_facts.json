The only material against the applicant was a confessional statement by co-accused Bacchansing Bhond, which was later retracted. There was no recovery of the stolen property at the instance of the applicant, and no Test Identification Parade was conducted. The court found no reasonable grounds to conclude that the applicant was part of the organized crime syndicate led by Lakkadsing Shitalsing Dudhani."
