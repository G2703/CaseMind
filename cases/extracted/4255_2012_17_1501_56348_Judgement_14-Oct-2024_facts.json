The incident occurred on 30.10.1997 when the deceased, Abdul Hameed, was shot in the courtyard of his house. The prosecution's case was based on eyewitness accounts, primarily from the victim's family members. The High Court confirmed the Sessions Court's decision, leading to the appeal in the Supreme Court. The appellant argued discrepancies in witness statements and lack of specific evidence tying him to the crime, while the State maintained the conviction was supported by eyewitness testimony. The Supreme Court had previously granted bail to the appellant during the pendency of the appeal."
