Accused No.1 (Arjun Baban Jagdhane) was a Police Inspector and accused No.2 (Jagannath Shivram Jadhav) was allegedly involved in the acceptance of a bribe. The complainant, Ruksana Banu, alleged that accused No.1 demanded a bribe to release her brother-in-law, Mohd. Nabi Qureshi, from custody. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was involved, and a trap was set up leading to the arrest of the accused. The defense argued that the accused were falsely implicated and questioned the competency of the sanctioning authority."
