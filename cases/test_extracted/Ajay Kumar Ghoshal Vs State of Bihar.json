    "prosecution_version": "On May 15, 2007, Asim Kumar Chatarjee (PW-5) filed a complaint stating his sister, Bandhavi @ Bani Ghoshal, was married to Raj Kumar, son of Ajay Kumar Ghoshal, on February 3, 2007. He alleged that the husband (Raj Kumar), father-in-law (Ajay Kumar Ghoshal), and mother-in-law (Munmun Ghoshal) demanded dowry, and upon his inability to fulfill the demands, they tortured his deceased sister mentally and physically. On May 15, 2007, PW-5 received information that his sister died in her matrimonial home in suspicious circumstances. He went to Bhagalpur, saw the dead body, and noticed that her wrist veins were cut, and her body had marks of hanging, assault, and electrocution. An FIR was registered, and a charge-sheet was later filed under Sections 302, 304B, 201, 498A, 120B IPC, and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.",
    "defence_version": "The appellants (accused) preferred separate appeals against their conviction and sentence. Their counsel submitted that the High Court, as the First Appellate Court, should have appreciated the evidence on its own merits, and it erred in remitting the matter back to the trial court to proceed afresh, arguing that the order for a de novo trial would cause serious prejudice to the accused-appellants.",

  },
  "reasoning": {
    "analysis_of_evidence": "The High Court had pointed out certain lapses in the investigation or 'conduct of trial' but failed to state how such alleged lapses resulted in a miscarriage of justice necessitating retrial. The Supreme Court noted that the High Court, being the First Appellate Court, was duty bound to examine the evidence and arrive at an independent finding and examine whether such lapses actually affected the prosecution case or resulted in a failure of justice. The Supreme Court also found that the High Court had not properly appreciated the ratio laid down in *Nar Singh vs. State of Haryana* (2015) 1 SCC 496, as a retrial from the stage of Section 313 Cr.P.C. is only warranted in cases where the failure to question the accused on incriminating evidence has resulted in serious prejudice.",
    "credibility_assessment": "The High Court's order directing retrial was found unsustainable because it failed to state how the lapses resulted in a miscarriage of justice, which is an exceptional prerequisite for ordering a retrial.",
    "legal_principles_applied": "The power to order a retrial under Section 386(b)(i) Cr.P.C. is to be exercised only in exceptional cases where the appellate court is satisfied that the omission or irregularity has occasioned in a failure of justice. Circumstances warranting retrial include: the trial court having no jurisdiction, trial being vitiated by serious illegality or irregularity on account of the misconception of the nature of proceedings, irregularity resulting in a miscarriage of justice, or the original trial being unsatisfactory due to wrong admission/rejection of evidence or refusal to hear certain witnesses. A 'de novo' trial, meaning a 'new trial' ordered by an appellate court, should be the last resort limited to extreme exigency to avert 'a failure of justice'.",
    "circumstantial_chain": "",
    "court_findings": "The High Court erred in remitting the matter back to the trial court for a fresh trial. The High Court had not shown how the alleged lapses resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The High Court erred in applying the ratio laid down in *Nar Singh's case*. The appellate court, when an appeal is preferred against conviction and sentence, is duty bound to consider the evidence on record and independently arrive at a conclusion."

  "judgement": {
    "final_decision": "Appeals allowed. The High Court's impugned judgment setting aside the conviction and directing retrial is set aside.",
    "sentence_or_bail_conditions": "",
    "directions": "The matter is remitted back to the High Court for consideration of the matter afresh. The High Court shall afford sufficient opportunity to the accused-appellants and the prosecution and also to the informant, Asim Kumar Chatarjee (brother of the deceased), (in terms of Section 301 Cr.P.C.) and proceed with the matter afresh in accordance with law."
