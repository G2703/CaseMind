A not mutually inclusive. If an accused is acquitted under one section, it does not mean that the accused cannot be convicted under another section. According to Section 113B of the Evidence Act, presumption arises when a woman has committed suicide within a period
B of seven years from the date of the marriage. In the present case, after going through the documentary evidence and the version of the witnesses, the accused were convicted u/ss. 304B and 498A of the IPC.
C Therefore, a reasonable apprehension can be raised, for that the accused committed a crime under Section 304B of the IPC and a presumption can be raised under Section 113B of the Evidence Act, since seven years of marriage had not been completed. [para 13] [879-D-G]

D *Balwant Singh and Ors. vs State of Himachal Pradesh 2008 (13) SCR 1111 = (2008) 15 SCC 497*- relied on.

2. It is not easy to gather direct evidence in cases of dowry death because such crimes are generally
E committed in the privacy of residential homes. That is why the legislature has by introducing Sections 113A and 113B of the Evidence Act, tried to strengthen the prosecution hands by permitting a presumption to be raised if certain foundational facts are established and
F the unfortunate event has taken place within a period of seven years. [para 14] [880-A-B]

*State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh and Ors.1991 (2) SCR*
*790 = (1991) 3 SCC 1* – relied on.

G 3. The first criterion with regard to establishment of guilt in the cases of dowry death is that the suicide must have been committed within seven years of marriage. The second criterion is that the husband or
H some relative of the husband had subjected the victim

to cruelty, which led to the commission of suicide by A
the victim. This is when Section 113A of the Evidence
Act indicates that in such circumstances, the Court may
presume, having regard to all the circumstances of the
case, that such suicide has been abetted by her
husband or by such relative of her husband. In the B
present case, both the above mentioned criteria have
been satisfied, since the deceased died within seven
years of marriage and with the version of the witnesses
i.e. PWs 1, 7, 8 and 9, it has been further proved that
there was cruelty meted out to the deceased C
immediately before her unfortunate death. [para 16]

A past, which was further strengthened by the fact that none
