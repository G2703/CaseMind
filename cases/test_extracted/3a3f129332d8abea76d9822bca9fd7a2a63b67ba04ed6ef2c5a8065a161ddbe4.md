(Criminal Appeal No(s). 1122-1123 of 2018)
07 January 2025
**[B.R. Gavai, K.V. Viswanathan and**

**Issue for Consideration**

Whether the prosecution has proved by leading clinching
and convincing circumstantial evidence that the accused had
committed forcible and violent sexual assault on the child victim
and, thereafter, strangled and killed her.

---

**Headnotes**†

**Penal Code, 1860 – ss.302 and 376 – Prosecution case that**
**accused had committed forcible and violent sexual assault**
**on the child victim and, thereafter, strangled and killed her –**
**The trial Court found accused/appellant guilty of the offences**
**punishable u/ss.302 and 376 of IPC – Trial Court awarded**
**capital punishment to the accused/appellant – The High Court**
**confirmed the death reference – Accused filed appeal before**
**the Supreme Court – During pendency of the appeals, the**
**accused expired – However, application submitted by the**
**legal heirs of the appellant u/s. 394 (2) CrPC for continuation**
**of the instant appeals:**

**Held:** The following circumstances stand firmly established from a
threadbare analysis of the evidence available on record, pointing
towards the guilt of the accused appellant – The child victim was
a friend of the daughter of the accused, and they used to go to
Madrassa together – On the date of incident, the child victim was
seen with the daughter of the accused – However, she never
reached Madrassa – An extensive search was conducted – The
needle of suspicion pointed towards the house of the accused –
After many search attempts, PW-12 inspected the bathroom of
the accused by lighting his torch and found a heap of clothes,
which was removed by PW-8 and the dead body of the child victim

was discovered concealed thereunder – Two stones of the septic
tank inside the house of the accused were also found moved –
Blood-stained pink colour midiskirt (MO-7), petticoat (MO-8) and
black miditop (MO-9) worn by the deceased child victim were
identified by her mother(PW-9), recovered by the police officials
from the house of the accused and were seized – As per the
postmortem report, a total of 37 ante mortem injuries were found
on the child victim’s body – The cause of death was opined to be
manual compressive and ligature constrictive strangulation – As
per the FSL report, the midiskirt worn by child victim, the dhoti of
the accused and cotton gauze collected from the scene of crime
contained human spermatozoa and semen – The hair collected
from the crime scene matched with the hair of the deceased child
victim – The DNA report clearly proved that the DNA profile of
the semen stains found on the midiskirt (MO-7) matched with that
of the accused – Further, the blood stains found on the cot and
beneath it were that of the deceased child victim – Other belongings
of deceased child victim were also recovered – Based on the
analysis of the evidence on the record, the chain of incriminating
circumstances required to bring home the guilt of the accused
is complete in all aspects – In the instant case, the prosecution
has proved by leading clinching and convincing circumstantial
evidence that the accused had committed forcible and violent
sexual assault on the child victim and, thereafter, strangled and
killed her. [Paras 25, 26, 27]

**Evidence – Circumstantial Evidence – Principles that courts**
**must adhere to while appreciating and evaluating evidence**
**in cases based on circumstantial evidence:**

**Held:** (i) The testimony of each prosecution and defence witness
must be meticulously discussed and analysed – Each witness’s
evidence should be assessed in its entirety to ensure no material
aspect is overlooked; (ii) Circumstantial evidence is evidence that
relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact. Thus,
the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the testimony
of each witness must be explicitly delineated; (iii) Each of the links
of incriminating circumstantial evidence should be meticulously
examined so as to find out if each one of the circumstances is
proved individually and whether collectively taken, they forge an
unbroken chain consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt

of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence; (iv)
The judgment must comprehensively elucidate the rationale for
accepting or rejecting specific pieces of evidence, demonstrating
how the conclusion was logically derived from the evidence – It
should explicitly articulate how each piece of evidence contributes
to the overall narrative of guilt; (v) The judgment must reflect
that the finding of guilt, if any, has been reached after a proper
and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine
whether they are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis.

                                               Judgment

Mehta, J.

1.  These appeals assail the judgment and order dated 28th February,
    2018 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala at
    Ernakulam in Criminal Appeal No. 1452 of 2013 and Death Sentence
    Reference No. 3 of 2013¹. The Death Sentence Reference and the
    Criminal Appeal arose out of the judgment dated 31st July 2013
    passed by the Court of Sessions Judge, Manjeri² in Sessions Case
    No. 487 of 2012.

2.  By the aforesaid judgment, the learned trial Court found the appellant
    (the sole accused) guilty of the offences punishable under Sections
    302 and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860³ and sentenced
    him as follows:
    (i) Under Section 302 IPC: Death sentence (subject to the
    confirmation by the High Court)
    (ii) Under Section 376 IPC: Rigorous Imprisonment for 7 years and a
    fine of Rs. 1,000/- (in default to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment
    for two months). [This imprisonment was allowed to be set off
    under Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973⁴]

3.  Being aggrieved by his conviction and sentence awarded by the
    learned trial Court, the accused preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1452

1   Hereinafter, being referred to as D.S.R. No. 3 of 2013
2   Hereinafter being referred to as ‘trial Court’
3   Hereinafter being referred to as ‘IPC’
4   Hereinafter being referred to as ‘CrPC’

of 2013 before the High Court. Since the trial Court awarded capital
punishment to the accused appellant, the matter was referred to the
High Court under Section 366 CrPC for confirmation of the death
sentence _vide_ D.S.R. No. 3 of 2013. Both D.S.R. No. 3 of 2013
and Criminal Appeal No. 1452 of 2013 were decided by the High
Court _vide_ common impugned judgment dated 28th February 2018
whereby, the Criminal Appeal was dismissed, and the Death Sentence
Reference was allowed confirming the death sentence awarded to
the accused. Being aggrieved, the accused appellant has filed the
present appeals by way of special leave.

4. This Court _vide_ order dated 4th September, 2018, stayed the execution
of death sentence awarded to the accused appellant.

5. During the pendency of these appeals, the appellant passed away
on 16th January 2024. An application was submitted by the legal
heirs of the appellant before this Court under Section 394(2) CrPC
for the continuation of the present appeals to wash off the stigma
attached to the accused appellant and his family which was allowed
_vide_ order dated 1st February, 2024.

6. Brief facts relevant and essential for the disposal of these appeals
are as follows: -

6.1 The prosecution story in brief is that on 4th April, 2012, at about
6:30 am, the child victim aged about 9 years was proceeding
from her house to the Madrassa situated at Ponnamkallu in
Amarambalam Village. On the way to the Madrassa, she went
to the house of the accused which was situated on the side of
the panchayat road at Ponnamkallu, in search of her friend who
is the daughter of the accused so as to go to the Madrassa
together.

6.2 On seeing the child victim all alone, the accused who was also
alone in the house, committed rape upon her in a room in his
house at around 6:45 am, and after that, he strangled the child
victim with a shawl and smothered her with his hands which
lead to the death of the victim.

6.3 It is the case of the prosecution that the accused, with the
intention to destroy evidence, concealed the dead body of the
victim beneath a cot inside the bedroom in the said house.
Thereafter, the accused shifted the victim’s dead body to the
