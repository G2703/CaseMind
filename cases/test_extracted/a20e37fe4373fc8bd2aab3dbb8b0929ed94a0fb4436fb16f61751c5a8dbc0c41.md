               IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY

                   CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 479 OF 2005

Abdulwafa Abubakhar Khan & Anr   ...Appellants

Versus

The State of Maharashtra      ...Respondent

.....

Mr. M.H. Bandrekar, Advocate for Appellants

Mr. Y.S. Shinde, A.P.P. for State.

.....

                      CORAM: SMT. V.K. TAHILRAMANI, J.

                      DATED: 10TH JUNE, 2005

           P. C.:
1. Heard the learned advocate for the appellants and

the learned A.P.P. for the State.

2. The appellants i.e. original accused Nos. 1 and

2 have filed this appeal challenging the judgment and

order dated 21.3.2005 passed by the 8th Ad-hoc

Additional Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay at Sewree.

By the said judgment and order both the appellants

have been convicted under Section 392 r.w.  Section

34 of I.P.C. and sentenced to R.I. for three years

each and to pay fine of Rs.500/- each i/d to suffer

R.I. for one month.

3.  The learned advocate for the appellants states

that he does not wish to argue this matter as far as

the merits of the matter are concerned and he will

restrict his submission only to the period  of

sentence imposed onthe appellants. He has further

submitted that the sentence imposed on the accused is

only three years and the appellant No.2 has been in

custody since the date of arrest i.e. more than two

and half years. Thus he has submitted that he is

making submission in the present appeal only in

respect of sentence. As the learned advocate for the

appellants has restricted his submission only to the

quantum of sentence, by consent of both sides, this

appeal is disposed of at the admission stage itself.

4.  The appellants are involved in a robbery of cash

of Rs.4080/-. Thus, it is seen that total value of

the property involved is only Rs.4080/-. As far as

the appellant No.2 is concerned, he has undergone

more than two and half years of imprisonment. As far

as the appellant No.1 is concerned he had been

granted bail by the lower court and hence he was in

custody for about a year. However, as far as the

appellant No.1 is concerned he is a young boy of 20

years.  The learned advocate for the appellants has

submitted that there are no antecedent as far as

these appellants are concerned. This statement has

not been controverted by the prosecution.

5.  Thus, in this view of the matter, I am inclined

to reduce the sentence of imprisonment of both the

appellants to the period undergone by them.  Fine

amount of Rs.500/- has been imposed on both the

appellants.  The learned advocate for the appellants

states that the said fine amount has been paid by

both the appellants. The fine amount of Rs.500/
imposed  on the appellant  No.2 is  maintained.

However, the fine amount of Rs.500/- in respect of

the appellant No.1 is increased to Rs.5000/-.

6.  In the result, the conviction of the appellants

under Section 392 r.w. Section 34 of I.P.C.  is

confirmed.  The sentence of imprisonment of both the

appellants is reduced to the period undergone by

them.  The appellant No.2 be released forthwith if

not required in any other case. The appellant No.1

if not required in any other case, be released on

making payment of differential  fine amount  of

Rs.4,500/-.

7. Criminal appeal is partly allowed.
