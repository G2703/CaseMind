Pandian). Accused No. 2 obtained information about the house's topography and inmates' movements from his mother, accused No. 5 (Bellaithai), who worked there. On 24.11.1992, the accused persons, armed with a gun, pistol, knife, and ropes, entered the house through the chimney. Inside, Devendran twisted the neck of one old lady, causing her death, while accused No. 3 (R. Thungamalai) tied her legs. Devendran then strangulated a second old lady with a piece of cloth while the second accused (R. Pandian) held her legs, leading to her death. When the car driver, Nagarajan, entered the house, Devendran shot him dead. The accused then stole jewellery and other items and escaped.",

They also argued that non-compliance with Section 306(4)(a) CrPC vitiated the proceedings. If the approver's evidence is excluded, the residuary evidence, including the recovery of some ornaments from R. Pandian and R. Thungamalai after two months, is insufficient to establish the charges beyond reasonable doubt. It was further argued that the murder of three persons, under the given circumstances, did not justify the imposition of the death sentence as a 'rarest of rare' case.",

Since the murder and robbery formed part of the same transaction, possession of stolen ornaments by the accused establishes guilt for both under Section 114 of the Evidence Act. Furthermore, the merciless killing of two ladies and the driver indicates a depraved mind, justifying the death sentence in this rarest of rare case.",
                    "defence": "The order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate granting pardon after the case was committed to the Sessions Court was a total lack of jurisdiction, not a curable irregularity under Section 460(g) CrPC, rendering the approver's evidence inadmissible. Without the approver's evidence, the prosecution's case fails, as the residuary evidence is insufficient to prove the charges, particularly against the co-accused. The recovery of property after two months from the co-accused only points to possession of stolen property, not murder. The circumstances of the deaths do not place the crime in the 'rarest of rare' category, and therefore, the death sentence must be commuted."

                "reasoning": {
                    "analysis_of_evidence": "The Court concluded that the Chief Judicial Magistrate had no jurisdiction to grant pardon after the case was committed to the Sessions Court under Section 307 CrPC, and this error was not curable under Section 460(g) CrPC. Consequently, the approver's evidence (PW-1) was excluded. The conviction of the main accused, A. Devendran, was sustained on the residuary evidence: the ocular evidence of PW-2 and PW-5, the corroborating medical and ballistic evidence, and the recovery of stolen property from him two days after the incident, which raised a presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act. However, the evidence against the co-accused, R. Pandian and R. Thungamalai, was found insufficient for the murder charge, as the recovery of property from them two months later was only sufficient for conviction under Section 411 IPC.",
                    "credibility_assessment": "The Court rejected the High Court's view that the jurisdictional error in granting pardon was curable. The Court distinguished the scope of pardon under Section 306 (before commitment) and Section 307 (after commitment), affirming that the power rests exclusively with the court to which the case is committed. The Court also held that the approver's statement was not wholly exculpatory, but its jurisdictional invalidity led to its exclusion.",
                    "legal_principles_applied": "The power to tender pardon after commitment lies exclusively with the Court of Sessions under Section 307 CrPC. A Magistrate cannot exercise this power, and such an act constitutes a total lack of jurisdiction, not a curable irregularity under Section 460(g) CrPC. Non-compliance with Section 306(4)(a) CrPC is not mandatory when pardon is granted under Section 307 CrPC. A presumption under Section 114, Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act, linking the possession of stolen articles to murder, can be drawn if the recovery is made soon after the incident. For the death sentence, the 'rarest of rare' doctrine requires the act to be diabolical, ghastly, or gruesome, and the death of multiple persons alone is not determinative.",
                    "circumstantial_chain": "Excluding the approver's evidence, a complete chain of circumstances was established against A. Devendran through: the presence of ocular witnesses, medical evidence supporting strangulation and shooting, the recovery of the murder weapon (pistol) linked by ballistic evidence to the shooting death, and the timely recovery of stolen property from his person, which, coupled with the nature of the crime, supported conviction for murder and robbery. The chain was broken for the co-accused on the murder charge due to the two-month gap in the recovery of stolen property.",
                    "court_findings": "The Court found that the order granting pardon was without jurisdiction and excluded the approver's evidence. A. Devendran was found guilty of murder (302), house-trespass (449), and voluntarily causing grievous hurt (326) but did not deserve the death penalty. R. Pandian and R. Thungamalai were found guilty only of receiving stolen property (411 IPC)."
